#  Experience iOS 16
## About the app
* This is an app that accepts users input from forms 
* Users can add movie titles, directors, ratings and reviews of the movie
* The app also saves the user's input data using the Core Data framework


## What I've Learnt
1. Core Data is a really powerful framework that does so much than just save data
    1. It allows you to programatically access and manipulate data to perform CRUD operations
    2. It provides the ability to link the attributes and define relationships
    3. It also provides an way to make data available throughout the application environment
2. Core Data use is somewhat manual than expected but this means you can explicitly design how your app access/passes data across
3. SwiftUI and Core Data can really work well together to produce a really powerful application for users to enjoy. 
4. You can use the `SortDescriptor` together with attributes to determine the order of how Fetched results are returned.
